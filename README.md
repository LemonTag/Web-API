# Portfolio
This is Day 4 Challenge
# Description
What was my motivation?
My motivation was to make a learn how to make javascript, honselty this was really hard. I have trouble learning how to build anything it was a tough battle for me to get anything done. Thankfully I had some help to work on the project and get it done. I just hope I can keep ketchuping with people on other assigments.
Why did you build this project?
I build a log in and a blog page. I made a log in so you have to fill in areas to get into the next page, if you didn't then it would give you an alert saying you have to fill out the rest of the stuff.
What problems does it solve?
I sloved how to change the theme from dark theme to light theme. I also learned how to make setItem in the console in the inspecter .
What did I learn?
I learned that javascript is hard and it will take time for me to learn. I how to make a form for html. I also learned how to make alerts in the loggin when all the stuff hasn't been fillout. 
What makes your project stand out?
My project stands out with how everything goes well with each other, with how the dark/light theme works to the login and when you pressed the back button it works as well.

# Installation
What I did was open git labs, and I made a git clone of the challenges I had to do into a separate folder, which I then made into my Challenges folder. 
After that, I went into my git hub, created repositories for my Web-API, and connected them with my challenges folder using git bash. I also created my assets folder there.
Then, I open the folder using Visual Studio code to make my index.html and style.css to use my project.
I used my git bash to add commit my work and pushed each time I made something new in my Web-API project.
